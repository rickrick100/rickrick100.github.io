## Welcome to CBMS Dashboard

The Community-Based Monitoring System (CBMS) was developed in the Philippines by Dr. Celia Reyes in 1993 to fill in the necessary information for more evidence-based planning and program implementation and for monitoring the micro-impacts of macro policies and shocks particularly on the most vulnerable groups of the population. CBMS is an organized process of collecting, processing, validating and use of data for various development concerns. It was designed as a system that can be used and sustained by LGUs overtime and facilitates sharing at each geopolitical level for purposes of better policymaking and program implementation. While it generates a core set of indicators that will enable monitoring of the multidimensional nature of poverty overtime, the system has flexibility to accommodate other indicators that can aid more in-depth analysis of emerging thematic concerns including gender and development, monitoring the millennium development goals and now the sustainable development goals (SDGs), facilitate, and impact monitoring of economic and non-economic shocks among others. Since the adoption of CBMS by LGUs in the Philippines in 2000 as a tool for local development planning, the coverage of CBMS in the country has expanded to 77 provinces (32 of which are implementing CBMS provincewide), 903 municipalities and 80 cities covering at least 24,677 barangays.
